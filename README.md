# RESQ_RASA_PROJECT - SETUP GUIDE

**INTRO**
-----
In this section I will go through every process step by step to help you set everything up.

**STEP 1:** IDE / Code Editor
-----
I would recommend using either PyCharm or Visual Studio Code as this is what the guide is based on.

**STEP 2:** Installation of RASA
-----
You will need to have python installed in order to run RASA, you can get that here if you don't have it already
https://www.python.org/downloads/ - RASA States to use either version 3.7 or 3.8.

Once python is installed ensure that you are able to use the PIP package manager by opening a command prompt and typing "pip".
If that works you are ready to install RASA, do that by typing:
```
pip3 install rasa[full]
```
This installs RASA together with all the machine learning-related dependencies needed to run RASA.

**STEP 3:** Installation of Android Studio, Emulator and NPM
-----
To run the application I would recommend getting yourself a virtual device to edit code and seeing the changes in instantaneous.
