(commands are case sensitive)

 

To log in, use git bash:

ssh tsta19@student.aau.dk

 

ls – (list) Check what’s in the directory

cd – change directory fx “cd ../” means go to parent directory

 

everything on linux starts at “/” (base of the whole system)

cd /srv/shiny-server/rehab/

 

cd /srv/shiny-server/rehab/WhackDash/

Corresponds to accessing files that are here:

https://rehab.shiny.create.aau.dk/WhackDash/

 

In order to git clone in there, you need to do it with “admin rights”

sudo git clone https://github.com/ThomasST4/RESQ_RASA_PROJECT.git

 

to update your repository:

sudo git pull

 

to remove:

rm

 

to remove a folder:

sudo rm -r <foldername>

 

to restart the shiny server:

sudo systemctl restart shiny-server

 

small trick: in the terminal, you can search for commands by doing “Ctrl+R”

 

to install packages on the server (you don’t want to do this too often please). I don’t think it needs sudo:

sudo R -q -e "install.packages('ggplotify', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"

 

if your app does not want to run or writes errors, try reading the logs you find in here using “cat”:

/var/log/shiny-server.log

 

See the log files by doing:

ls /var/log/shiny-server/

 

and open them using “sudo cat”
